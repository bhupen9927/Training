                       anyone, anywhere, at any time. They also realized there were many
                       others who wanted to support good ideas. So they left the Bank to
                       launch the world’s first crowdfunding community in 2002. Today,
                       people in more than 165 countries can easily share their ideas,
                       and individual donors and companies can easily support vetted 
                       nonprofits.</p>
