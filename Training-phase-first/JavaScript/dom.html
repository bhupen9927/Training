    <h1> JAVA SCRIPT DOM</h1>
    <p>When we start accessing this document Object
        we have a whole lot of properties and methods
        available to us straight out of the box, and we
        could access these properties and methods<br>
        
        Just understand that almost every single interaction on your page, for example like slideshow on a carousel, navigating menu items
        all are result of the javascript accessing and manipulating the DOM<br>

        Where does the DOM Come from?<br>

        The Dom doesnt comes from Javascript. The browser gives us the access to the DOM. This means that different browsers will have their own
        unique way of creating the DOM.<br>

        Everything in the browser can be represented as an Object
    </p>
